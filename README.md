HTML & CSS

This was my take on a project for Skillcrush. It is a website for a fictional team building retreat. This was my first multi-page site and my first fully responsive project. I particularly enjoyed the challenge of figuing out how to make the huge header image respond the way I wanted it to regardless of the device on which it is viewed.
